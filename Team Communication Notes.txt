Hey guys... just a quick text document to help keep our thoughts in one place.

Eric ->  I'm going to do all of the requirement pieces on Saturday.  If no one else starts anything...
I will also get the framework and the requirements thrown into a Powerpoint document that I will put
on GitHub.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Olga -> I will try to update the introduction part during weekend.

Still need to add more content. Please look at first draft and comment if you think something important is missing. It would be nice to add some screenshots of the templates to our first presentation (Ethan?).
