Hey guys... just a quick text document to help keep our thoughts in one place.

Eric ->  I'm going to do all of the requirement pieces on Saturday.  If no one else starts anything...
I will also get the framework and the requirements thrown into a Powerpoint document that I will put
on GitHub.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Olga -> I will try to update the introduction part during weekend.
